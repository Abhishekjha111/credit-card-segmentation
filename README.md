# credit-card-segmentation
Segmentation in marketing is a technique used to divide customers or other entities into groups based on attributes such as behaviour or demographics. It is useful to identify segments of customers who may respond in a similar way to specific marketing techniques such as email subject lines or display advertisements. As it gives businesses the ability to tailor marketing messages and timing to generate better response rates and provide improved consumer experiences.In the following post, I will be using a dataset containing a number of behavioural attributes for credit card customers. The dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle website. I will be using the scikit-learn python machine learning library to apply an unsupervised machine learning technique known as clustering to identify segments that may not immediately be apparent to human cognition. The dataset consists of 18 features about the behaviour of credit card customers. These include variables such as the balance currently on the card, the number of purchases that have been made on the account, the credit limit, and many others. A complete data dictionary can be found in the repository.
